# The Movie Searcher Applicaiton

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run build` fails to minify

## Project Spec

### The Stack

For this poject I was required to use a specific stack and was restricted to the following technologies:
- React
- React Bootstrap
- Easy-Peasy
- .fetch() API (javascript function)

### The Requirement

The requirement behind the project was to build a simple movie searching app with restricted technologies as mentioned above. The following features are what a user can expect when using this application. The user will ba able to search for movies on the home page and they will be default display in a card layout. They will be able to toggle  between Cards and List items using the Toggle button on the Navbar. The user will then be able to select individual cards or list items (movies) to view further detail about the movie. Once the modal has popped up and the user is able to view the extra information, they will be able to add the movie to their favourites list.

The favourites list can be found on the navbar, the user may click that and then be presented once again with either cards or list items (depending on what was selected) They Toggle remains in state and will persist as it sits inside of the local storage and the toggle selection will affect both the favourites page and the search results page. The user will also be able to remove movies from their favourites by going into the "more information" screen.

## Personal Thoughts

I thoroughly enjoyed building and working on this little project. It is a passion of mine to be working with React as well as learning new technologies to go along with it. React has been built to be a fun and thought provoking framework that makes the whole process not only fun but also efficient and streamlined. This project also put my styling and UX to the test, it isn't perfect but it was a lot of fun trying to build what I had envisioned upon the initial reading of the spec.
